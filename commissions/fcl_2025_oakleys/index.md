Art by the elusive [Oakley](https://x.com/oakleycreations). Another con another piece. Oakley primarily deals with fursuits but they were doing commissions at [Furcation Land](https://furcationland.org/) 2025 and I had to get one. Attempting to round out all of the [Lojban attitudinals](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lojban/Attitudinals) I asked Oakley to draw "pride" (aka `o'a`).

<div class="tab-wrapper">
	{% capture tab_content %}
		{% include components/figure.html 
			link = "./final.png"
			inside = ""
			type = "static_image"
		%}
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/tab_item.html 
		index = "1" sub_index = "a"
		name = "final.png"
		content = tab_content
	%}
</div>
