Work done by the underappreciated [geckoZen](https://www.deviantart.com/geckozen/journal/Commissions-info-442208992). This was a holiday gift for Fenrick (the fennec pictured). This was a joke that we had talked about for a while. [Defenestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration) is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window. It is only fitting that it happens to a fennec. 

As always I'm in love with zen's work. All of the details in this picture such as the evil idem and [idem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwuotc9f-Ug)'s [sedums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedum) are wonderful and I'm supper appreciative of the care and attention to detail zen has. I would seriously recommend you look at their work and ask about commissions!
