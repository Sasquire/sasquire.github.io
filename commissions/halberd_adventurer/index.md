Art by the sensible [Khai](https://twitter.com/KhaiTheBear). I was able to snag a piece from Khai back in May when they opened their commissions and they finished it within two weeks and then posted it come June. I love the piece and all the small little nick knacks that idem is carrying. The armor is practical for what an anthro character would wear and the color theming is great. My only complaint is that the halberd could have been longer (it can always be longer).
