Art by the stable [Troutsworth](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/). This is a piece I got from trout's patreon. The prompt (among other options) was "Something greatly reducing the lifespan of idem". I think this piece meets that request pretty well!

<div class="tab-wrapper">
	{% capture tab_content %}
		{% include components/figure.html 
			link = "./final.png"
			inside = ""
			type = "static_image"
		%}
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/tab_item.html 
		index = "1" sub_index = "a"
		name = "final.png"
		content = tab_content
	%}
</div>
