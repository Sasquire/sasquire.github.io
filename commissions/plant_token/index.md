Art by the talented [Ratte](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/ratte/). Spending summers landscaping, I knew that [Hydrangeas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrangea) were the perfect poof plant. Just look at 'em. They're perfect! So I was thinking about how I could get a hydrangea poof on a MtG token, and the answer stuck out to me like a sore thumb when I saw [Avenger of Zendikar](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/9/6/9685faa0-46cc-4098-9ad7-cffece741baa.jpg?1673484460). Now I will be able to kill my opponents with fluffy zombies *and* plants!

I have not printed these yet, but I usually use [Board Games Maker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/) for and they have come back great in the past! An alternative I'm thinking of using is [Make Playing Cards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) 

There are a few alternative colors and sketches that can be found only in the github repository for this website! If you just can't get enough of these tokens, go check it out!

And some sketches so you can see the development progress of this image. There is a jump between shading and the final image where I wasted hours of ratte's life with tedious minutia (I'm sorry ratte!). Something to learn from this: Never trust flat colors to be shaded the same way. Some artists go heavy on the shading and it can change and image dramatically.
