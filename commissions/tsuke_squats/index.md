Art by the adept [tsukemono](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/kemonotsu). [Tsuke](https://e621.net/users/167041) used to have a daily fitness club on the [e621 discord](https://e621.net/static/discord) where they would award tsuke-coins to those that participated. Eventually these tsuke-coins could be redeemed for doodles. I was very late for redeeming my coins (over a whole year!) but [tsukemono](https://twitter.com/tsu_kemono) very graciously still allowed me to cash them in for a doodle. I tried to be on theme with my purchase and went with something that I hoped could be used as a shorthand for future tsuke-workouts.
