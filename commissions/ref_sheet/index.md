It's finally here! After a four month wait I can finally call my ref sheet from the amazing and patient [troutsworth](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/) finished! I have to first apologize and thank trout for putting up with all of the nitpicks, re-do's, and and just inane problems I had. What you see here is the culmination of all the versions trout made. I have taken the time to clean and reorganize the mess of versions into an easily digestible order. If you are a purist, the `color_2` files are the final version I received from trout while the `final` ones are after I changed some details I was not going to trouble them with.

# Alternative Versions?

If you're an artist and I've sent you to this page, you probably know the password to unlock these alt versions.
