Art by the elusive [Vega](https://bsky.app/profile/starhoundart.bsky.social). I got this piece from Vega/StarHound At ANE 2024. I saw their booth in the Artists' Alley and decided to ask for a headshot piece. Out of the suggestions for emotion of `o'a`, `ii`, or `a'e` (pride, fear, alertness) it appears they chose fear! I love the piece and have thoughts about turning it into a sticker or emote.
