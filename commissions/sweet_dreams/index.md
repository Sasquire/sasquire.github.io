Art by the creative [Troutsworth](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/). I received this piece for being subscribed to Trout's patreon. Not of my character but a gift for Fenrick involving one of theirs. This image could be found on Trout's FurAffinity under the same name but I am hosting it here for myself.
