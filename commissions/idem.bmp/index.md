Art by the eternal [TheRoguez](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/theroguez/). I've passively followed Roguez for a while. I found their work, somewhere..., and was immediately in love with it. I use a FoxFox and YoteYote lanyard for my car keys and have received some compliments. When I saw TheRoguez post on Furaffinity they were taking commissions for a MSPaint inspired headshot portrait I knew I had to get one. It came out great and I adore it. It makes me want entire pieces done with a limited palette and dithering. I am a big, big, big fan of aliased work. I don't know how to explain it I just am.
