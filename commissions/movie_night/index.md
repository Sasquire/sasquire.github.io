[Art](https://www.deviantart.com/geckozen/art/Movie-Night-comm-1075062148) by the esteemed [geckoZen](https://www.deviantart.com/geckozen/journal/Commissions-info-442208992). Fenrick and I had been talking about getting a picture to represent all the media they've subjected me to and as soon as I saw Zen's work I knew it would have to be from them. I love how the piece came out and Zen was great to work with. I still have ideas I hope they will bring to life in the future.
