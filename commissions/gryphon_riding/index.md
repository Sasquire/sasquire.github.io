Art by the undiscovered [Bloubutt](https://bloubutt.carrd.co/). I got a recommendation of Lou from Fenrick and was impressed with their work. Enough to ask for a commission of a silly idea I've had for a while. Feral gryphon rides! I will not lie and say that a certain post (titled gryphon rides) by [troutsworth](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/) did not inspire me. I'm very happy with how the piece came out and if I come up with any ideas befitting Lou's style I'd come back and try to get more from them!
