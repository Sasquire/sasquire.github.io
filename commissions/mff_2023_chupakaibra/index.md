Art by the interesting [chupakaibra](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/chupakaibra). At MFF 2023, located not in the artist alley but in the dealers den, Chupakaibra had a tiny booth where they offered "shitty commissions". Essentially a five minute commissions of your character done in crayon right there while you watch.

Really happy with how this came out despite how it may look on your screen. I really need to get a better scanner if I keep getting physical media. A few digital tweaks and the images look as they're supposed to.
