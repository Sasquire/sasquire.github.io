[Art](https://www.patreon.com/posts/magic-poofening-42408976) by the talented [Ratte](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/ratte/). Mana tokens were something that I had been thinking about for a while. I never used them that often, but storm players, hoo boy let me tell ya. Now they are fun little gifts to give out whenever I go to events. Find an opponent that made your day? Give them a set of their favorite colors! Watching some people struggling to keep track of mana? Give them a couple!

I used [Board Games Maker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/) for printing off these tokens and thought they came back great!

There are a few alternative colors and sketches that can be found only in the github repository for this website! If you just can't get enough of these tokens, go check it out!
