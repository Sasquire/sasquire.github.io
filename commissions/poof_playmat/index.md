[Art](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/32171928/) by the talented [Ratte](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/ratte/). I wanted a playmat for MTG, but I guess you could use it as a mousepad if you wanted. People always ask me what the things on it art and I just have to say, well, they're poofs! I got my playmat made at [Inked Gaming](https://www.inkedgaming.com/) and have been really pleased with it.
