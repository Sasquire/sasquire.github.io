Art by the peculiar [SadCat16hrz](https://twitter.com/sadcat16hrz). I've been following DouglasCat for a while (I still have a shout on FA that is two years old where they are thanking me for a watch) and while I'm not a fan of their stranger creations, I'm a sucker for the cartoony art they make. The prompt was "something cutesy sfw colored doodle of Fenrick and I with a theme of flowers" and Douglas did not disappoint with this lovely piece!
