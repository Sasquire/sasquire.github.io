## Welcome to my site!

I make a lot of strange things and need somewhere to house them (I should get a labyrinth). I lack any great long-term solution, so the temporary bodge-solution is this.

If you are looking something, it is probably in [the blogs](/blogs/) directory. These are just short snippets of code, usually paired with a graph, and designed to be sweet, simple, and to the point. Don't expect earth-shattering revelations here.

If you're looking for something more substantial, it may be some project I've made. Unsurprisingly, projects can be found in [the projects](/projects/) directory. These are usually something meatier than a blog but not big enough to be contained wholly in it's own repository.

And for the biggest projects, they can be found on [my github](https://github.com/sasquire).

If you're a weirdo, you might be looking for the [commissions](/commissions/) I have gotten. This is really for my own organization anyhow.
